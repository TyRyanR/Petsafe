APPROACH TAKEN
#########
This one was a toughy. I didn't realize at first but I wanted to have two seperate models with access to a join model. However, I went the route of creating the two models that would've been separate into ONE model. Therefore, a self referential was to take place. I really learned a lot about the limitless ways you can go about referencing other models, nesting resources, etc with this project.

UNSOLVED PROBLEMS
#########

1) Didn't figure out how to use jQuery in Rails
2) Didn't learn how to use devise because I did session's manually
